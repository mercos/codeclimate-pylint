# Code Climate Pylint Engine

`codeclimate-pylint` is a Code Climate engine that wraps the [Pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint) source code analyzer. You can run it on your command line using the Code Climate CLI, or on our hosted analysis platform.

### Installation

1. If you haven't already, [install the Code Climate CLI](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate).
2. Enable the engine in your .codeclimate.yml file:
```
engines:
  pylint:
    enabled: true
```
3. You're ready to analyze! Browse into your project's folder and run `codeclimate analyze`.

### Configuration

You can configure which files to be analyzed in your `.codeclimate.yml` file.

Other configurations can be made through a `.pylintrc` file. More information can be found on [Pylint's documentation](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

PYTHONPATH can be modified by setting the PYTHONPATH configuration variable:

```yaml
engines:
  pylint:
    enabled: true
    PYTHONPATH:
      - src
```

This adds the `src` directory to PYTHONPATH before running `pylint`. Relative paths are properly resolved to the current directory.

Plugin activation can also be made in `.codeclimate.yml`:

```
engines:
  pylint:
    enabled: true
    plugins:
      - django
```

Currently the following plugins are supported:

- [pylint-django](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django)
- [pylint-celery](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-celery)
- [pylint-quotes](https://github.com/edaniszewski/pylint-quotes)

We welcome PRs adding support for other plugins.
